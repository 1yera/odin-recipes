    <p>Street tacos are a traditional Mexican snack of warm corn tortillas 
        typically filled with meat topped with onions, 
        cilantro and often a spicy sauce. Their presence is growing on 
        American menus as consumers' interest in Latin-American cuisine, 
        and in foods they see as authentic, continues to increase</p>
